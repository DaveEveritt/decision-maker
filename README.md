# Decision maker

Originally ported to Meteor from a pure Javascript prototype, now reverted to the latter because… frameworks.

## TO DO

- [ ] increment numbers on each reason
- [ ] use a component for list items
- [ ] limit reasons to 7 decisions for/against to manage cognitive load/indecision

## TO DONE

- [x] add input and handler to enable users to add for/against
- [x] restrict length of reasons to a reasonable length (110 chars)
- [x] use CSS classes instead of `style.color`
