# Decision maker

Originally ported to Meteor from a pure Javascript prototype, now reverted to the latter becauseâ€¦ frameworks.

## TO DO

- [ ] use queue code in projects/js-queue/javascript-examples
- [ ] add input and handler to enable users to add for/against
- [ ] use a component for list items
- [ ] use CSS classes instead of `style.color`
- [ ] limit reasons to 7 decisions for/against to manage cognitive load/indecision
- [ ] restrict length of reasons to a reasonable length
