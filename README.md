# Decision maker

Because decisions are hard for me, I made this.

## TO DO

- [ ] branch master in "static", merge textinput into master
- [ ] clear text input after entry
- [ ] fix long decimals in %
- [ ] multiply calculations for % by 100
- [ ] limit reasons to 7 decisions for/against to manage cognitive load/indecision

## TO DONE

- [x] update decision totals
- [x] increment numbers on each reason
- [x] add input and handler to enable users to add for/against
- [x] restrict length of reasons to a reasonable length (110 chars)
- [x] use CSS classes instead of `style.color`

## FUTURE?

- [ ] use a component for list items

## Notes

Originally ported to Meteor from a pure Javascript prototype, now reverted to the latter becauseâ€¦ frameworks.
